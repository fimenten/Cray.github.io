## Features

- Upload and download trays to a remote server.
- Optional end-to-end encryption for transfers. When uploading or downloading,
  you can specify a password. If a password is supplied the payload will be
  encrypted using AES-GCM before being sent. Unencrypted transfers are still
  supported for backwards compatibility.
