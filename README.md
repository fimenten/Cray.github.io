## GitHub Pages by Branch

This project deploys to GitHub Pages using the `work` branch. Whenever
changes are pushed to `work`, GitHub Actions builds the project and
publishes the content automatically. You can view the live site at the
URL above.

To deploy from another branch, update `.github/workflows/static.yml`
and change the branch name under the `push` configuration.
