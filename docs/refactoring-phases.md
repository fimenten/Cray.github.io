- [ ] Clean up memory leaks in event listeners
- [ ] Standardize error handling patterns

**Success Criteria**:
- All existing tests pass
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- 0 circular dependencies

- [ ] Implement data validation
- [ ] Add immutability helpers

#### 2.2 Separate Business Logic
- [ ] Create `TrayService` for business operations
- [ ] Extract tree operations to separate module
- [ ] Implement proper event system
- [ ] Create action/command pattern for operations

#### 2.3 Update Serialization Layer
- [ ] Migrate to use `TrayModel` instead of `Tray`
- [ ] Add data versioning support
- [ ] Implement migration utilities
- [ ] Enhance validation

**Success Criteria**:
- All data operations work with new models
- Serialization tests pass
- Business logic is testable in isolation
- Clear separation between data and UI

**Risk Level**: Medium (core architecture changes)

### Phase 3: UI Component Refactoring (Week 5-6)
**Goal**: Create clean UI components separate from data

#### 3.1 Create UI Component Layer
- [ ] Implement `TrayView` component
- [ ] Create `TrayRenderer` for DOM operations
- [ ] Implement component lifecycle management
- [ ] Add proper event handling

#### 3.2 State Management Overhaul
- [ ] Expand Redux store to handle all state
- [ ] Replace element2TrayMap with Redux state
- [ ] Implement selectors for derived state
- [ ] Add proper action creators

#### 3.3 Event System Modernization
- [ ] Implement centralized event bus
- [ ] Replace direct DOM manipulation
- [ ] Add typed event system
- [ ] Implement proper cleanup mechanisms

**Success Criteria**:
- UI components are reusable and testable
- State is managed centrally in Redux
- No direct DOM manipulation in business logic
- Event system is type-safe and clean

**Risk Level**: High (major UI changes)

### Phase 4: Performance & Architecture (Week 7-8)
**Goal**: Optimize performance and finalize architecture

#### 4.1 Rendering Optimization
- [ ] Implement virtual DOM or efficient diffing
- [ ] Add component memoization
- [ ] Optimize re-rendering patterns
- [ ] Implement lazy loading improvements

#### 4.2 Plugin System Enhancement
- [ ] Update plugin APIs to use new architecture
- [ ] Implement type-safe plugin interfaces
- [ ] Enhance plugin sandboxing
- [ ] Add plugin lifecycle management

#### 4.3 Final Architecture Cleanup
- [ ] Implement dependency injection
- [ ] Finalize module boundaries
- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Create architecture decision records

**Success Criteria**:
- Rendering performance improved by 50%
- Plugin system is more robust
- Architecture is clean and well-documented
- All patterns are consistent

**Risk Level**: Medium (performance optimizations)
